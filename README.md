I developed this software for a friend who runs an online personal training business. He needed a graphical interface with a MySQL database to manage client information, allowing him to send individual or mass messages to clients associated with his "adminIndex."

This project was a significant learning experience for me. I discovered methods for displaying user-specific information and refined my skills in integrating MySQL databases with user interfaces. It feels great to have built something that someone actively uses!
